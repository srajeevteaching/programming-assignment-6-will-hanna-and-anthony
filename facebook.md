# PA6: Facebook 

## Problem

Write a program that reads in the data from the file **facebook.csv**, stores it in a list of lists, and then answers the following questions about that data. The program should give a menu with all options and should only end when the user chooses the option to end from the menu.

1. What is the difference between number of likes and number of shares for each post? This information should be output for each post to a file that the user chooses. Is it significantly more likes, more likes, the same, more shares, or significantly more shares? You should consider a change of +/- 25 to be no change. Changes for +/- 100 are significant. 

2. Create a graph that shows the number of posts with low, moderate, and high numbers of engaged users. A low number is less than 100 and a high number is greater than 400.

3. A Facebook page can post many different types of updates. But which type gets the most likes? Determine how many likes each post type gets on average.

4. A question of your choosing!
