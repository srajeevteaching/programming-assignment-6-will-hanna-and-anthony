Problem
The problem will be different for each team. Once your team has chosen a dataset, you can download problem-specific instructions/data files from Moodle.

Instructions

Use comments to write the algorithm your program will follow, including functions.
Write the Python code corresponding to each of your algorithm's steps.
Commit and push changes and check your repository on github.com to confirm your updates before the deadline.
